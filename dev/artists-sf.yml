      long_desc: |
        My artistic inquiry delves into the essence of transitional states within spaces, inspired by the rich tapestry of Persian literature, particularly the poetry of Rumi, and informed by my background in urban studies. Against the backdrop of Iran's recent revolutionary movement for freedom and social justice, encapsulated by the rallying cry 'Woman, Life, Freedom,' I find profound significance in exploring the liminal spaces that characterize our socio-political landscape.

        Central to my practice is the exploration of spaces and their inhabitants as interconnected entities undergoing perpetual transformation. I am drawn to the nuanced interplay between vulnerability, intimacy, visibility, and history within these transitional states. Through photography, I endeavor to capture the ephemeral essence of these moments, where borders blur between the temporal and eternal, interior and exterior, personal and political.

        In my proposed project, I aim to employ portraiture in a conceptual framework to delve deeper into the notion of the constant transitional moment. Through a series of black and white and color photographs, spanning portraits, cityscapes, landscapes, and still lifes, I seek to articulate the fluidity of mental states as spaces evolve and intertwine.

        Each image, while possessing individual narrative power, contributes to a larger visual tapestry that transcends the confines of traditional frames. The envisioned body of work extends beyond the realm of isolated photographs, inviting viewers into a contemplative journey through sequences that challenge conventional notions of time and perception. By capturing the essence of transitions between interiors and exteriors, the project invites reflection on the mutable nature of existence and the intricate interplay between personal and political spheres.

        The culmination of this exploration will manifest in a comprehensive photo book and exhibition, curated to engage viewers in immersive dialogue with the thematic underpinnings of the work. The exhibition space, meticulously selected for its capacity to amplify the project's conceptual resonance, will serve as a dynamic platform for the convergence of art and introspection.

        Through my artistic practice, I aspire to facilitate a nuanced discourse on the fluidity of existence and the intricate interplay of spaces and identities. By transcending the confines of the visible, my work endeavors to illuminate the unseen threads that bind us in our collective journey of becoming.

      long_desc: |
        As a European, I have long wondered how the American West – “Arid Region of the United States” in John Wesley Powell’s words – became home to sprawling megacities, epicenter of the entertainment and technology industries, and a primary source of agricultural products, in short an integral part of American Power?

        Water Manipulation and Control – on a monumental scale – is at the heart of this apparent paradox.

        Developed over five years and spanning eleven states, Hydraulic Empire explores the past, present, and future prospects of what is quite simply – in terms of technological accomplishments and wealth created – the most ambitious semi-desert civilization project in History.

        Ever since the Reclamation Act (1902), a fierce ambition to tame geological and hydrological forces across a region as vast as the European Union gave rise to a Promethean, federally-funded, infrastructure: over 12,000 dams, thousands of miles of canals and rivers virtually running uphill, shifted by gigantic pumping stations.

        Hydraulic Empire investigates some of these emblematic sites as well as the contemporary oasis civilization they made possible, occasionally unveiling faint traces of stories beyond the engineering prowess, a history of conflict and controversies, social repercussions or environmental damage.

      long_desc: |
        Heat: Portraits of the Invisible World is a series of portraits taken with a high-resolution thermal camera. I began using this camera in 2016 and was immediately fascinated by its properties, which upend the traditional values of photography. Light is not the defining issue. Instead, what we see is temperature. What we interpret initially as light is actually heat, and dark is cold, or the inverse, since you can set the values how you want. Typically, thermal cameras are used for surveillance, espionage and for the detection of chemicals, radiation, nuclear emissions, explosive materials. You can use them to find heat leaks in your home. What interests me, though, is how this camera illuminates the human figure.

        The thermal camera takes away the familiar. It removes the physical characteristics that often divide us socially, such as gender, race and age. Instead, radiating from each portrait are the biological commonalities that unite us—breath, sweat, inflammation and the warm circulation of blood. You are forced to see differently.

        The thermal camera enables me to present an alternate vision of what a portrait can be—unfamiliar, void of prejudice and focused on what I like to think of as the essence of an individual.

        My curiosity is always about that which can’t be seen—breath, the electrical pulses that run through our bodies, disease, even feelings of love and loss—and how to manifest these interior phenomena into imagery that not only resonates with the viewer but lingers long after with its beauty, complexity and mystery. At a time when we are so divided in this country, in this age of polarity and punishment, with partisan politics and strangled language, my interest is in what connects us, the raw humanity within us. My hope is to inspire people to see that connectivity. This series is a declaration that beyond the boundaries of visibility are elemental truths that bind us as human beings.

            I was drawn to photography for its ability to clarify the complex and the indescribable. The strongest images do so with a distinct emotional resonance –in just a few frames. Judging this grant rearmed my belief in photography. I saw work that inspired curiosity, cultivated humility, and – forgive the cliché – left me seeing my surroundings in a different way.

            In the winning project Where They Still Remain, Austin Bryant pays tribute to the African American and Wampanoag indigenous communities that reside on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. Merging his own original photography with carefully curated – and, on occasions, altered – archival materials, Bryant draws evocative and thought-provoking observations about land, the humans who shape it, and the material and cultural heritage they leave behind. There is a remarkable intentionality in each frame – it is clear Bryant deeply cares about the area and its people.

            I also want to acknowledge another deeply moving project I saw. In Cancer Works, Annie Flanagan documents their experience going through chemotherapy after they were diagnosed with breast cancer. The work intertwines the raw and the poetic seamlessly. Their photographs – and their words – are something that will stay with me for a long time.

      long_desc: | 
        I grew up at the pivotal time of technological change. Landlines were replaced with cell phones, email replaced letters, inexpensive laptops replaced computer labs, and social media has since replaced everything else. Having lived with and without an online world I began to question the nebulous boundaries between these modalities and consider the points of intersection and overlap.

        Our media saturated world shapes how we see and project ourselves. I have felt the physical pain of staring into a screen, acknowledged the haunting specter of surveillance, and felt the fear and anxiety for a world I cannot see, hear, or touch. Simultaneously I have found respite in curated programs and felt comforting closeness of distant loved ones through computer generated light beams. Guy Debord wrote, “Everything that was directly lived has receded into a representation.” That the representation is in turn being directly lived. Online programs track and store our behavior and we become code and algorithms. Do we have a human future or have we become commodities as we project and consume our own images? Is our future already automated and curated for us? Do we have a choice in the formation we seek or do we live in our own echo chambers?
        
        It is from this uncertain place that I create work. I use my body as source imagery through lens based devices creating an intimate performance between human and the machine. Digital photographs, captured through low-tech devices, create intimate moments where technology and humanity converge. Vivid color and fragmented images both draw the viewer in and obscure information. They evoke emotions of connection, isolation, closeness, and vulnerability, prompting us to question which of our versions of self are complete.

  bio: |
    Ada Trillo is a queer, first-generation Mexican-American artist who merges documentary and fine art in her photography. Growing up on the border between Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas, has given her an intimate understanding of the border. This has inspired her to explore national and metaphorical borders of inequality in her work. She focuses on walls of inclusion and exclusion, such as those based on climate and violence related to migration, as well as internal exclusions resulting from long-standing barriers of race, class, gender, and trauma that have been influenced by colonization.

      long_desc: What does someone's culture, heritage, and identity say about a person?  his work began after a recent experience when my personal documents were deemed invalid because they held my married name and not my given name when I was first applying for a passport. I would need a picture ID of me as a child to prove my name and my identity. I was deeply hurt, in shock, and angered. It felt like erasure. I began thinking about the validity of documents. The weight that piece of paper has, that “papers” have. And of the fact that they are simply paper. I use corn husks to re-create my papers on something I valued–corn. At the beginning, I knew I would make cyanotypes of my birth certificate and marriage license on the husks–and give them the validity that was taken away from them. Shortly thereafter I realized that the experience made me question my roots and the idea of home. What home is and who has a right to dictate what home is and who has a right to it. And with that, cultural identity. So, I thought about what being home means to me. Being home is ultimately my mother and her cooking. I began making prints of specific, traditional herbs my mother uses in her cooking. To me they are her and her story, her childhood, how she learned and her stories about cooking with them. That is home. It also made me aware that as people, no matter where one is from, no matter where one is, the mere thought of our homeland food–its aroma, its taste, will immediately transport one home. This is the heart and intent of this work. It gave me the validity I’d lost. It gave me the permission to feel whole. It made me work–hard. But, I believe, it also gives others a voice. One, through a humble corn husk.

        Washed Up is an environmental installation and photography project that transforms the international garbage washing ashore on Mexico’s Caribbean coast into beautiful, yet ominous works. 
      
        The project addresses the issue of plastic pollution making its way across the ocean and onto the shores of Sian Ka’an, Mexico’s largest federallyprotected reserve. I have identified plastic waste from fifty nations on six continents all found along a single stretch of coastline. I collect this international debris and use it to create color-based, site-specific installations. Conflating the hand of man and nature, at times I distribute the objects the way the waves would; at other times, the plastic takes on the shape of algae, roots, rivers, or fruit, reflecting the infiltration of plastics into the natural environment. The resulting photo series depicts a new form of colonization by consumerism, where even undeveloped land is not safe from the far-reaching impact of our disposable culture. Although inspired by the work of Andy Goldsworthy and Robert Smithson, Washed Up speaks to the environmental concerns of our time and its vast quantity of discarded materials. The alchemy of Washed Up lies not only in transforming a trashed landscape, but in the project’s potential to raise awareness and change our relationship to consumption and waste. The installations are photographed with a large format camera, using 4 x 5 color negative film. Exhibition prints are 40” x 52” archival pigment prints. A short documentary film accompanies the current exhibition.

        Wildfires - and their impact on our lives and psyches - are growing in intensity and frequency. However, the sensationalism of most news coverage fails to explore the nuances and complexities of evacuee’s inner experiences.

        In 2020, I had to abandon my home, running through the night for safety as streaks of dry lighting hit the surrounding hilltops. I wasn’t allowed to return for three weeks.

        Schrödinger's Cat is a 1935 quantum mechanics thought experiment devised by Erwin Schrodinger in conversation with Einstein. In it, a hypothetical cat - trapped inside an opaque box with a flask of poison - is considered to be both alive and dead, simultaneously. This “dual state” continues until you look inside the box. Only by looking, can you resolve the reality. Until that moment, the cat is considered both alive and dead. Not possibly dead or possibly alive, but alive and dead at the same time.

        This series explores the experience between evacuation and return, a time when your mind thrashes about, reaching for solid certainty in a sea of the unknowable. In an era known as “The Information Age,” this not-knowing was particularly uncomfortable. For weeks on end, having to simultaneously hold two realities - "alive" and "dead" - for something as intimate, foundational, and personal as home was both excruciating and fascinating. It broke and rebuilt my sense for how we construct and accept reality. Unable to look inside the box, my mind was forced to bend in unnatural ways, unable to rest - as we are so accustomed to - in just one reality.

        In this series, I explore the surreal duality of those days, blending the mundane details of everyday life with the cataclysmic drama of disaster, feelings of hope with the crushing weight of loss, magical thinking with sobering truths, and even some humor amidst all the tragedy.
