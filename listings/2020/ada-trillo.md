bio: | 
    Ada Trillo is a queer, first-generation Mexican-American artist who merges documentary and fine art in her photography. Growing up on the border between Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso, Texas, has given her an intimate understanding of the border. This has inspired her to explore national and metaphorical borders of inequality in her work. She focuses on walls of inclusion and exclusion, such as those based on climate and violence related to migration, as well as internal exclusions resulting from long-standing barriers of race, class, gender, and trauma that have been influenced by colonization.

After traveling through Guatemala and crossing the Suchiate River into Mexico, this newest caravan of asylum seekers was treated to the same appalling tactics being carried out at the US/Mexico border. 

It seems now that the two Governments are working in tandem to deal with Central American Migrants in some of the most inhumane ways imaginable. When the migrants arrived at the border of Guatemala and Mexico, they were gassed and pepper sprayed on their first attempt to cross. 

The government officials began to trick asylum seekers into entering Mexico in smaller, more manageable groups. Promising them a chance at applying for asylum or continuing on to the US Border, only to force them onto buses so that they can be deported back to their respective countries in Central America. 

I watched men weep, feeling that they were trapped in an impossible situation. Their journey ahead was obstructed by cruel government policies, yet returning to their homeland could mean living a life of extortion, impoverishment, and possibly death at the hands of the ruling gangs.
