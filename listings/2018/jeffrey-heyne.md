Summertime 1898, a group of 200 Ute Indians traveled from their reservation to their ancestral hunting grounds in Colorado. The newspaper reported they journeyed there “to hunt a moon”---a month-long period. 

To enforce the state’s forestry laws protecting wildlife, the US Army was mobilized. The Ute conferred, and with the intimidating threat of US soldiers looming, the Ute acquiesced and were escorted back to their reservation.

After almost 9,000 moons, this was probably the Ute’s last hunt on their native lands.
