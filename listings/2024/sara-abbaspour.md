My artistic inquiry delves into the essence of transitional states within spaces, inspired by the rich tapestry of Persian literature, particularly the poetry of Rumi, and informed by my background in urban studies. Against the backdrop of Iran's recent revolutionary movement for freedom and social justice, encapsulated by the rallying cry 'Woman, Life, Freedom,' I find profound significance in exploring the liminal spaces that characterize our socio-political landscape.

Central to my practice is the exploration of spaces and their inhabitants as interconnected entities undergoing perpetual transformation. I am drawn to the nuanced interplay between vulnerability, intimacy, visibility, and history within these transitional states. Through photography, I endeavor to capture the ephemeral essence of these moments, where borders blur between the temporal and eternal, interior and exterior, personal and political.

In my proposed project, I aim to employ portraiture in a conceptual framework to delve deeper into the notion of the constant transitional moment. Through a series of black and white and color photographs, spanning portraits, cityscapes, landscapes, and still lifes, I seek to articulate the fluidity of mental states as spaces evolve and intertwine.

Each image, while possessing individual narrative power, contributes to a larger visual tapestry that transcends the confines of traditional frames. The envisioned body of work extends beyond the realm of isolated photographs, inviting viewers into a contemplative journey through sequences that challenge conventional notions of time and perception. By capturing the essence of transitions between interiors and exteriors, the project invites reflection on the mutable nature of existence and the intricate interplay between personal and political spheres.

The culmination of this exploration will manifest in a comprehensive photo book and exhibition, curated to engage viewers in immersive dialogue with the thematic underpinnings of the work. The exhibition space, meticulously selected for its capacity to amplify the project's conceptual resonance, will serve as a dynamic platform for the convergence of art and introspection.

Through my artistic practice, I aspire to facilitate a nuanced discourse on the fluidity of existence and the intricate interplay of spaces and identities. By transcending the confines of the visible, my work endeavors to illuminate the unseen threads that bind us in our collective journey of becoming.
