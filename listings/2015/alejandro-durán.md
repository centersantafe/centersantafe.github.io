  Alejandro Durán is an artist who transforms international trash washing ashore on Mexico's Caribbean coast into aesthetic yet unsettling artworks, awakening viewers to the threat of plastic pollution. His long-term project, “Washed Up: Transforming a Trashed Landscape,” uses photography and installation to explore the complex intersections of humanity and nature, highlighting the pervasive impact of consumer culture on the natural world. Durán engages audiences through environmental, community-based art-making workshops and speaking engagements. As National Geographic’s Becky Harlan noted, “A gorgeous UNESCO World Heritage site has a serious problem with ocean trash, and artist Alejandro Durán wants to inspire us into action.”

Washed Up is an environmental installation and photography project that transforms the international garbage washing ashore on Mexico’s Caribbean coast into beautiful, yet ominous works. 

The project addresses the issue of plastic pollution making its way across the ocean and onto the shores of Sian Ka’an, Mexico’s largest federallyprotected reserve. I have identified plastic waste from fifty nations on six continents all found along a single stretch of coastline. I collect this international debris and use it to create color-based, site-specific installations. Conflating the hand of man and nature, at times I distribute the objects the way the waves would; at other times, the plastic takes on the shape of algae, roots, rivers, or fruit, reflecting the infiltration of plastics into the natural environment. 

The resulting photo series depicts a new form of colonization by consumerism, where even undeveloped land is not safe from the far-reaching impact of our disposable culture. Although inspired by the work of Andy Goldsworthy and Robert Smithson, _Washed Up_ speaks to the environmental concerns of our time and its vast quantity of discarded materials. 

The alchemy of Washed Up lies not only in transforming a trashed landscape, but in the project’s potential to raise awareness and change our relationship to consumption and waste. 

The installations are photographed with a large format camera, using 4 x 5 color negative film. Exhibition prints are 40” x 52” archival pigment prints. A short documentary film accompanies the current exhibition.
