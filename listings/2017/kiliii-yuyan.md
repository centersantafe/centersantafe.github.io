For a foreigner to a Native village in the Alaskan Arctic, the difference is in the ice, the smell of the walrus, the quiet way that Iñupiat speak. But underneath lies the deeper values of an indigenous identity, a lifestyle that prioritizes sustainable land practices. The Iñupiat are the indigenous people of the North Slope of Alaska, whose culture developed around the practice of whaling. For over 2,000 years they have patiently hunted bowhead whales from sealskin boats. Kanisan Ningeok explains, “We sit on the ice and hope the whale gives itself.”

For two years, I have been documenting Iñupiat life in the village of Utqiagviq, Alaska. There I spent several seasons on the sea ice alongside a traditional Iñupiat whaling family. I learned that vanishing sea ice is making traditional subsistence dangerous. Makalik Wilhelm says, “I don’t think people realize how dangerous it is out here... We hunt because we have to feed our community.”

Climate change makes the headlines the world over, but the unseen effect is the degradation of traditional culture. As globalization through television and internet has reached remote Arctic communities, suicide rates have skyrocketed. Drug abuse and crime are far higher in Native villages than nearby communities. For the young at-risk generation, tradition and subsistence remains important. The public defender for the Alaskan Iñupiat villages notes, “During the whaling seasons, probably four months of the year, crime becomes nonexistent. All the young men are out whaling.”

In spite of the challenges, the Iñupiat are not helpless victims. Their story is one of self-determination. The mounting challenges to prosperity are being met head-on through education and a resurgence of traditional practices. Yet the Iñupiat and all the Arctic peoples need help in awareness of their unique situations. This is about cultural understanding -- that outsiders living far away might gain insight into the unique challenges for Arctic indigenous and why money is needed to mitigate the effects of climate change.
